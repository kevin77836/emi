                            The Office of Bilingual Education intends to purchase Grammarly for Education and offer it free to full-time teachers, master's, and doctoral students who genuinely need this function. This purchase will encompass only 1,500 units at this time. Consequently, teachers, master's, and postgraduate students seeking this resource are urged to submit applications.
